Team DEVils present to you DextroVerse : The Future of ed-tech and beyond

The website is deployed at https://devils-mait.github.io/Dextroverse and provides 4 features namely :
1) VR classroom
2) AR learning
3) Disaster Experience 
4) Monument Venture

The AR learning feature ,VR classroom feature and Monument Venture feature are fully implemented and working on the website. 
On a few browsers, the VR feature will take about 30 seconds to load completely.

The Disaster Experience feature is implemented locally,
so we are attaching the corresponding video in the website only for reference.
